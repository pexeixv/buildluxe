After his graduation, a full scholarship from Pennsylvania State University enabled him to engage in research on the concept of ‘play’ and continue globetrotting. He visited Bhavana Hameed, his partner, who was then working with Ai Weiwei in Beijing. Patel says,

“I was so intrigued by Ai and his works, that I decided to stay put there. Working with him, I realised the power of simplicity and clarity of thought. His set-up in Caochangdi village with his house, studio, staff quarters, kitchen, workshop and 28 dogs, 18 cats, two goats and five piglets, was like a world in itself. That’s the kind of workplace we [Patel and Hameed] decided we should have in India.”

Among his inspirational icons is professor Anant Raje, who infused in him absolute discipline, rigour and clarity of expression.

And he admires Charles Correa for the ease with which his buildings, in particular Bharat Bhavan, negotiate sites.

After working with Weiwei, the duo returned to establish Playgroup Studio in Goa. Patel says, “An architectural language needs to arrive at a critical balance between self-imposed rules (grammar) and the freedom/variations afforded within it. This ensures the generation of Play within the language.”

While he believes that innovation is to design a cheaper, more efficient wheel, a dream project for him is to design a museum of world architecture. Patel adds that his path-breaking project is the Horizon school campus in Calicut, where the intention was to create a laboratory of ideas and creatively use educational concepts embedded within the architectural and space-making elements.
